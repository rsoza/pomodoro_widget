# Pomodoro Widget

Do you ever find yourself losing track of time while working on tasks? Or perhaps you prefer to use timers to stay focused on specific activities?

The Pomodoro Widget project aims to address these needs by providing a fixed Pomodoro timer conveniently located at the bottom right of your desktop. The timer can be set to the task at hand, with a designated start and end time.

## Project Overview

Currently, this project is a work in progress (WIP). While the basic functionality of the timer is implemented, it lacks the feature to dynamically set the task information. The timer is manually set within the code without associating it with specific tasks.

### Highlighted Abilities

In developing this project, I've demonstrated proficiency in the following areas:

- **GUI Development**: Utilizing Tkinter by creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Pomodoro Widget, allowing for an intuitive user experience.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: By structuring the codebase around classes, such as the `Widget` and `Interface` class, I've applied principles of object-oriented programming to enhance modularity and maintainability.

- **Time Manipulation**: Leveraging the `time` and `datetime` modules, I've implemented timer functionality, enabling accurate tracking of task durations and countdowns.


## How to Contribute

If you're interested in contributing to this project, here are some ideas to consider:

- Implement a user interface (UI) to allow users to input task information and set timers dynamically.
- Enhance the timer functionality by adding features such as pause, resume, and reset.
- Improve the design and customization options for the widget's appearance.
- Test the application across different desktop environments and operating systems to ensure compatibility.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with new ideas, and contribute your own improvements to make this Pomodoro Widget even better!
