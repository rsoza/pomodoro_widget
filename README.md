# Pomodoro Widget

Have you ever lost track of your next task or like to keep timers for certain tasks?

This project was made with the idea of having a fixed pomodoro timer fixed at the bottm right of your desktop. The timer is set to the task at hand with a start and end time.

So far I have not been able to complete the project so it is a WIP, the timer is manually set in the code without the task information. 

Feel free to add some ideas.
